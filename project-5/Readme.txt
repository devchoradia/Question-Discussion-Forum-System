a. 
I DID NOT use the departmentâ€™s MySQL server, instead for the project I used my own mySQL database that runs on my localhost.
I used PHP and MySQL for the backend part of the project.



b. 
I hardly made the use of jquery.
JQuery version: jquery-3.5.1.min.js




c.
I have included in "DBdata.txt" all SQL commands for creating the tables. So all these commands could be used in order to easily set up the database.
I have included all my files under one single directory, so it is easily accessable. So to start off, we just need to run the folder (index.php).
I ran this on localhost with the help of xampp (and also tried it with mamp for safety) with mysql and apache servers turned on.
Under xampp, all files were placed under a folder, which was placed inside a folder called htdocs. So on mac, using localhost/project, I could perfectly run my project.
(Just for information, for mamp, I had to use the password as "root" for mysqli_connect() and the link was localhost:8888/project)




d.
I managed to implement all the basic features mentioned for the project.
To the best of my abilities, I could complete all functions except the email format as abc@y.com. Other than that I think I implemented everything.
